11862402,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/ggG1,My Market Information?,"My Market The My Market reports show a variety of information about the current and recent state of your MLS market.  Five charts track and display statistics regarding your MLS market: Inventory, Sold DOM vs. Sold Price, Sold DOM vs. Units, Volume & Average Price, and Hot Sheet Price Change Trends.  Select the report you would like to view from the drop-down list. Note: These reports do not display up-to-the-minute statistics. Instead, they use previously cached data in order to generate information as quickly as possible.  As a result, recently updated listings may not be reflected in the report. You may generate the graphs from any search criteria, allowing for nearly unlimited customization of the data represented. Click the Customize button to define your criteria.  You may use a full search or a saved search to focus your results.  Please be aware, however, that choosing a listing status will significantly affect the resulting chart.  For example, a saved search for ""Active"" listings will not return relevant information about sold listings.  You may also use a previous Full Search from this session - such that if you have refined your search multiple times without navigating away from the My Market page, you can go back to a previous full search to view its statistics again. Inventory - The My Market Inventory chart gives a graphical representation of the state of your MLS market over the past two years. Using the bars and the red, gold, and black lines, you may track the inventory at rate of sales, and the number of active, new, and sold listings. The bars represent the months of inventory at the current rate of sales. The vertical legend at the left side of the graph shows the units of measurement, or you may hover over any bar to see the exact measurement for that month. The red, gold, and black lines correspond to the vertical legend at the right side of the graph. The red line tracks by month the number of active listings, black the number of sold listings, and gold the number of new listings. Hover your cursor over each line on any month to see exact values for that month. Below the graph, you may look at a numeric representation of the data. In table format, you may easily compare listings and inventory month-by-month over the selected time period. Sold DOM vs. Sold Price - The Sold DOM vs. Sold Price report displays a comparison between the Average Days on Market (the number of days between begin date and pended date) for Sold listings and Average Sold Price. The Average Days on Market are represented by columns, and the Average Sold Price by a black line. Data is presented for the past two years. Sold DOM vs. Units - The Sold DOM vs. Units graph charts Average Days on Market (the number of days between begin date and pended date) and Sold Units. The columns represent the DOM, and the black line represents the number of Sold Units. Below the graph, you may look at a numeric representation of the data. Volume & Average Price - The Volumes & Average Prices graph compares the Sold Volume (bars) to the Average List Price of the sold listings (grey line), and the Average Sold Price (black line) over the last selected time period. Hot Sheet Price Change Trends - The Hot Sheet Price Change Trends graph charts the Average Price Change percentage in comparison to the Average Price Change in dollars. This graph is based on only those listings where the list price was changed.

11862404,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/hAG1,TrueCloud Chat Basics- Expectations,"Response Times in Chat If you do not know the answer right away, make sure you are letting the subscriber know you are researching their inquiry.  This will let them know they are not being ignored. If you respond with a question or answer, and the subscriber does not answer back, these guidelines should be followed: If no response after 2 minutes , Support should respond with “ Are you still there? ” or “ Is there anything else I can assist you with? After this, wait another 2 minutes .  If no response, you will post the Bye chat canned response and end the chat.  We should not be waiting more than 4 minutes for a response. When is it appropriate to Call during a Chat Resetting Passwords in Chat We should NEVER ask a subscriber to verify Key Pin or Security Questions through Chat.  If a subscriber is having password trouble or PIN trouble, we should be going above and beyond by offering to call the them ourselves. Clearing Cookies/Cache with an Agent in Chat In order for the c lea r to complete, the subscriber must close out of all internet windows, including the Chat.  Instead of pasting the directions of how to Clear (and not knowing if it worked or not), we should be calling the subscriber and verbally walking them through the process.  This will help clear any confusion as well as make sure their issue has been solved. Calling Etiquette in Chat If a subscriber is having difficulty and asks for you to call them, or if they can call you, please follow through with the call yourself . DO NOT pawn the call of on another Support Person.  Making the agent call into Support will worsen the situation by forcing another Support Person to enter the call blindly.  The subscriber will be required to repeat themselves and a lot of time will be wasted for both. If our goal is to provide the industry benchmark for customer service, then we should be trying our best to make the situation better for all, not worse. Transferring a Chat Occasionally you may connect with an subscriber who has dropped the previous chat accidentally.  They may ask to be transferred back to their original Support Person so they do not have to explain themselves again.  You can find out who this is (if the agent did not name them) by checking the Atlas or reaching out in L1 Teams.  Under no circumstances should we ever “Cold Transfer” the Chat to this person.  If an Agent wishes to be transferred you will reach out to the party and make sure they are able to take the Chat.  If they are not, you can ask for the condensed version of their problem, then attempt to solve it yourself. Business Communication E tiquette Regardless of the medium that is being used to communicate with subscribers (in-person, phone, chat, email) maintain our level of professionalism . This includes, but is not limited to, proper grammar, capitalization, sentence structure, avoiding slang and abbreviations as much as possible.",False

The Listing Agent will need to individually contact each agent they would like to reach. In Metro MLS , a listing agent can select up to 200 agents at a time to send a Reverse Prospecting message to (System will not function correctly if you have over 200 selected. would need to send in batches of, at most, 200 at a time ).

11862424,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/mAG1,Property Panorama,"Property Panorama is no longer a product provided by SomeCompany with your subscription package, but it is still available at a small cost. What does Property Panorama do? Property Panorama will automatically create virtual tours, using photos in MLS, for SomeCompany listings for use by the Listing Agent. Tours will be created for eligible listings meeting all the following requirements: Have at least three photos In an Active or UCB status Included for display on internet Seller Directs Listing to be Excluded from Internet export setting is not checked Included for IDX IDX export setting is checked In a property type available via IDX Business Opportunity listings are not available in IDX *If any of these items are ‘No’ then a video will not be generated. * How are tours generated? When a new eligible listing is added (or an existing listing becomes eligible), a tour will be generated, and an email is sent to the Listing Agent containing a link to the tour. What to do if I don't receive the email with the tour link? Go to the Menu. Search 'Property Panorama'. Click Property Panorama. Property Panorama will open in the agents account using a Single Sign On. Click the Linking Page button for the property you want to copy the link for. Copy the link under the InstaView Lite. How to Copy: Highlight the link and right click the mouse button. Then click Copy from the dropdown menu or highlight the link and hold down Ctrl and click C.  Click the michael-ai Web Tab to go back to michael-ai and add the link to the Virtual Tour for the listing. Property Panorama checks for new/modified listings every 6 hours (or four times/day). How are tours added to listings in michael-ai? Once a Listing Agent receives a tour link via email or copies it from Property Panorama, the Subscriber will need to manually add the tour to their listing in michael-ai by: Going to the Add/Change screen for the listing Select Virtual Tour Add the link by pasting the link into the field. If the Subscriber does not want to use the tour, they simply take no action. What is contained in the InstaView Lite “free” tour? The InstaView Lite free tours will contain at least three and up to five photos from the listing. (These will be the first three to five photos on the listing in the MLS.) There is not an option to select specific photos from the listing, so the desired photos must be placed in the desired ordered in the first 3 to 5 photo positions. What happens if more photos are added/moved/removed from the listing after the tour has been created? The existing link will be updated with the new photos displaying the first three to five photos in the MLS system, so there is nothing the Listing Agent will need to do to see the changes reflected in a tour they have already posted. This will not happen immediately as Property Panorama only checks for new/modified listings every 6 hours (or four times/day). What happens when a listing goes to Pending (or other off market status) and then returns to Active or UCB? The free tours created will become inactive when the listing is changed to an off market status (or fails to meet any of the eligibility requirements). During this time, the user has total access to the tours but they will NOT be viewable to the public. If the listing is returned to Active or UCB status, the existing tour will be reactivated, thus no action is required by the Listing Agent. This will not happen immediately as Property Panorama only checks for new/modified listings every 6 hours (or four times/day) . What if a Subscriber already has a tour(s) in MLS? Will the Property Panorama tour replace the existing tour(s) in the system? The capacity for virtual tour links in the MLS system is unlimited. Thus the Property Panorama tour would just be added to the existing tours in MLS. The virtual tour is not automatically added to the listing so it will not replace tours that are already in the system. How often does Property Panorama update the Tour links? Tour links are updated every six hours (or four times/day). Who does a Subscriber contact if they are having trouble with a tour from Property Panorama? If they need assistance adding a tour to their listing in michael-ai, we (the SomeCompany HelpDesk) can assist them. They can call our HelpDesk at 480-303-7020, or email information@SomeCompany.com .

13566351,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/jwHP,New Portal 2.0 Q and A,"Portal 2.0 - Frequently Asked Questions What will the New Portal 2.0 look like: (In short: Much like the michael-ai App) Menu on the left Double row of Listings displayed as Cards in the middle or one row if the monitor is small. Map on the right Search bar at the top Where did the Dashboard go? Everything that is contained in the dashboard is now in the Menu to the left or in the messages option in the top right. It's now going to be all on one screen for easy access. Why did the new Portal come about? We are making the switch to simplify and update the Portal. The mobile version and the desktop version will be virtually the same in look and feel. The new Portal 2.0 has been released for 2 years in other markets. We elected to not release it until it had been beta tested by other markets. What are the new Features? Client Searches: The clients will be able to do their own searches but will not be able to save them unless agents have the IDX Manager from FBS. All on one-page display: The clients will not have to click around to find anything. Everything is displayed on one page. The Searches and collections to the left. The results in the middle and the map for location to the right. Simplify is the name of the game. The Updated Messages: The messages from Client to Agent and vice versa will look much like text messages: Agent can see Most Recent Unsaved Search parameters: In the clients Portal tab agents can check to see what their clients are searching for. This will indicate if the agent should contact the client and modify the saved search based off what the client is looking for. Client tutorials: The client will get pop up tutorials one at a time that are short and sweet to explain where everything is and what it does. If the Client Dismissed the tutorials they will not be available for review later. Please refer the client to the Client tutorial video on SomeCompany.com. Client can start and stop Subscriptions: The client can click on any saved search. Click the notifications bell on and get subscriptions or turn it off to stop the subscription emails. Important Note: No, there is not a way to know if the agent or client turned the subscription on or off. If the bell is not available, they are most likely on the News Feed or a collection not a search. If the client side says, ""Notifications are DISABLED"" this means that the search does not meet the minimum required fields for a subscription email to be set up. Basically, the search must use at least 3 fields for a subscription to be activated on the client side. How long will the intro video stay on the Portal Preferences screen? There is currently no plan to remove it. Why is supplement not an option to turn off now? The new portal is simplifying everything, even the settings. Supplement is just an extension of the public remarks. There was never an option to turn that off, so it makes sense to remove that setting as well. Click the More on the public remarks to read the supplement. Why are photos, videos, and virtual tours not an option to turn off now? Simplifying the settings is key. It's expected to see these things. If the photos and videos were not available, then most subscribers reported this as a bug and not an intended setting. Turning Photos, Videos, and Virtual Tours off in the settings was usually an accident. Vacation Available Dates calendar is not in the portal for Vacation rentals? This was custom programing for our MLS. We put in a ticket to have it added to the portals but currently have no ETA. On Vacation rentals the Current Price (High season) will show just like on other websites such as Zillow. Lo season price is in the detail information below the picture in the General Information section. Does the subscription notify the agent in anyway when the client turns it off? No Is there a way to tell if the agent or client created the search in the portal? The client's saved search will be listed on the Portal tab. The agent's saved search will be listed on the Searches/Subscriptions tab. Please Note: The agent must have an IDX Manager subscription from FBS in order for the client to have the ability to save their searches. You can identify the agents who have this subscription because they will have an option for ""IDX Manager"" under their Preferences in the Menu. Is there a way to see if the client or the agent created the subscription? No On the new Portal is there a way for the agent to Feature their listings? Yes, If the option in Portal Preferences: My Listings is turned ON then when the client visits the portal home page, they will see the agents Active Listings. This setting use to be an IDX Manager Feature only. Is there a way for the agent to see the client's portal? No, the View Portal button has been removed. We were told it was because it caused too much confusion. Agents would be on the desktop and the clients would be on a mobile device and neither understood why they weren't seeing the same things. Also, the View Portal didn't show things like the messages the client and agent wrote to each other. I would suggest that the agent set up their own portal, so they know what it looks like for the client. How long will the ability to switch from the old portal to the new portal last? There is not yet a defined time for the Classic Portals to be completely sunset and removed. How can the agent recommend listings, Save listings and Hide them on behalf of the client if they don't have a View Portal button? This can all be done the way it's intended by working on behalf of the client. Click the Searches/Subscriptions tab in the clients contact. Click the search. Click View all under the Results section and when going from the clients contact to the search results will automatically be working on behalf of the client. The Star (Save), Suitcase(Recommend), No Smoking Sign(Hide), and Note pad (Listing Note) will be available for the agent to use. When this is released will the system automatically change the agent's portal to the Portal 2.0 or will the agent have to manually change it? The agent will have to manually change it in the Portal Preferences and clicking the blue button, ""Try the new michael-ai Portal"" or if they do not wish to switch and need to see the Classic portal settings the agent will need to click the link, ""Access Classic Portal Settings"". When the New portal is applied to the account the Manual E-mail screen will be changed. The options above reflect the option available in the New portal. When the link is opened in the manually sent email it will be opening on the same mobile view/desktop view as the New portal would have. Below is an example of what the email link will open to on a desk top. Click the Card photo to see more details of each listing. However, manual emails will no longer be stored in the Portal 2.0. If using the Portal 2.0, permalinks are no longer customizable. Also, currently there is not a way to ""Save"" the preferred options if an agent calls and wants to know why when they uncheck Tax Info and they come back to this screen its checked again. If you get a complaint or suggestion, please send it to the MLSdept email. There is a ticket open for this. The more agents IDs we get the faster they will be to fix the issue. The notepad for Listing Notes is no longer available for the client to view or read. Agents should use the messaging feature for the conversations about the listing. Agents when ""Working on Behalf of Client Name "" in the search should use the person icon: and then click: Clients will use the big blue button in the upper right called: Contact Agent or View Conversation or There is no longer an option to be notified when the client logs into the portal when the New Portal is applied to the account in the Contact Management screens Portal tab: This option in the classic portal only worked when the client logged into the portal via a Desktop computer. Any mobile device that accessed the portal would not send a notice back to FBS's servers to show a login happened. Because the majority of portal logins are done from a mobile device it made the feature almost obsolete.",False

Using the quick launch search bar in michael-ai and within a quick/map search click on "" SomeCompany "" or "" Southeast Arizona Multiple Listing Service, Inc. "" Note: When a mikeai subscriber uses the quick launch bar to search for listings in mikeai, SomeCompany listings will show first.

13566502,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/JgLP,Supra End of Showing Notification Q&A,"Q. What are end of showing notifications? A. An email or text indicating a showing has ended. These can be sent to the seller's agent and anyone else they designate. Q. Why don't I receive showing notifications for my listing? A. First, verify you are set up to receive showing notifications: Go to www.supraekey.com and select Agents - Log on to SupraWEB. Enter your user ID and password and select Login. From the SupraWEB home page select SETTINGS. Select General Email. Enter your email address. Check each type of notification you want to receive and enter the additional email addresses for others you would also like to send the showing notifications to (broker, assistant, etc.). Click Save. Second, make sure the keybox at the listing is in your keybox inventory: In SupraWEB select LISTINGS Select Keyboxes under QUICK LINKS. If the keybox is not listed, add it by selecting Add Keybox. Enter the keybox serial number, shackle code and MLS# (if available) or address and click Add Keybox. Q. Why don't I receive an End of Showing notification every time my listing is shown? A. Only the eKEY app has the ability to detect and send end of showing notifications. Q. Why doesn't the end of showing notification include the listing address? A. No address has been associated with the keybox in SupraWEB. To assign a keybox to a listing: In SupraWEB select Assign Listing from QUICK LINKS and select the keybox. Enter the MLS # or address in the MLS # field. Select Assign. Q. Why does the ""Showing ended?"" prompt pop up hours after the showing has ended? A. The ""Showing ended"" prompt occurs 20 minutes after the keybox was opened if no other event has signaled the showing ended. The prompt will be displayed the next time the phone is turned on. Q . Who would be interested is receiving copies of the end of showing notifications? A. You may want to share end of showing notifications for individual keyboxes with homeowners so they know when the showing has ended at their home. End of showing notifications for all keyboxes in your inventory may be of interest to assistants, partners and your broker. Q. How is the end of showing detected? A. Whenever a keybox is opened, the eKEY app attempts to obtain a GPS location. Once the GPS location is obtained, a geo-fence around the property is established. The Supra system detects the showing has ended when one of the  following events occurs: The key leaves the geo-fence area after a showing. The key opens another keybox. Another key opens the keybox. The showing agent indicates that the showing ended (eKEY only). A prompt   appears on the showing agent's phone asking if the showing has ended 20 minutes after the keybox was opened, and again at 40 minutes, if no other  event has signaled the showing ended. If none of these events occur within 60 minutes of opening a keybox, the showing times out and the system sends a message that the showing ended due to a system timeout. Q . What happens if the end of showing cannot be detected? A. If no end of showing signal has been received by the Supra  system  within 60 minutes of the keybox opening, the showing times out and the system sends a message that the showing ended due to a system timeout. Q . How quickly will I receive end of showing notifications? A/ According to Supra, 93% of the notifications are sent within 10 minutes; 98% are sent within 15 minutes.  Since the showing notifications are triggered based on a number of settings, including one that is a setting on the phone of the showing agent’s eKEY, the showing notification can be delayed (hence the remaining 2%).  There are variables in the feature that can lead to an isolated outlier notification delivery that can occur beyond 15 minutes.  Due to the number of variables, pin-pointing a specific timing on these outlier notifications becomes exceedingly difficult. Cell coverage impacts the timeliness of the showing notification. The eKEY app must be in cell coverage to send showing notifications. Also, if a GPS fix cannot be obtained when the keybox is opened, a method other than the geo-fence must be relied on to signal the showing has ended. Q. How can I automatically let the homeowner know the showing has ended? A. You can set up the system so the homeowner automatically receives notifications for only that keybox: Go to www.supraekey.com and select Agents - Log on to SupraWEB. Enter your user ID and password  and select  Login. From the SupraWEB  home page select  LISTINGS. Select Keyboxes. Select the keybox serial number. Click on the Listing Details tab. Scroll down and check the Showing Notifications (for individual keybox) checkbox and add the email addresses of those you wish to receive the showing notifications. For text messages, enter the recipient's cell number following the convention shown on the screen. Click Save. Q . Can I send text notifications instead of email notifications? A. Yes. To send text showing notifications: Go to www.supraekey.com and select Agents - Log on to SupraWEB. Enter your user ID and password and select Login. From the SupraWEB home page select SETTINGS. Select General Email. Address the email to the recipient's 10-digit wireless phone number using the following format: Verizon: 5551234567@vzwpix.com AT&T: 5551234567@txt.att.net Sprint: 5551234567@messaging.sprintpcs.com T-Mobile: 5551234567@tmomail.net US Cellular: 5551234567@email.uscc.net Rogers: 5551234567@pcs.rogers.com Q. Why did the ""Showing ended?"" prompt appear when I was still showing the house? A. The ""End Showing?"" prompt appears if the end of showing has not been detected by another event within 20 minutes of opening the keybox. If the end of showing has still not been detected within 40 minutes of opening the keybox, the message will appear a second time. Tip: Turning on location services will reduce the number of times the prompt appears. Q. How do I turn off end of showing notifications? A. If you are set up to receive showing notifications, you automatically receive notifications when showings begin and end. To turn off showing notifications for all keyboxes: Go to www.supraekey.com and select Agents - Log on to SupraWEB. Enter your user ID and password and select Login. From the SupraWEB home page select SETTINGS. Select General Email. Uncheck the notifications you no longer want to receive. Click Save. If you have also set up showing notifications for an individual keybox, to turn off these showing notifications: Go to www.supraekey.com and select Agents - Log on to SupraWEB.

16679084,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/rID_/,InfoAI- Why Suppression Occurs,"Answer Most will explain it as the Client spamming/junking emails, but that is only a piece of the larger puzzle of Email Suppression. There are a few main reasons that a recipient's email address will become suppressed: A single hard bounce : If the recipient's email server responds with a permanent failure message, it will become immediately suppressed. The most common reason for a hard bounce would be that the email address simply doesn't exist. According to the SMTP protocol, mail servers are not to retry sending emails when the recipient's server has responded with a 5.x.x/hard bounce. Repetitive soft bounces : Mail servers will typically respond with temporary failure messages that recipient's inbox is full, when it's trying to throttle emails from the sending server, if it's under heavy load, etc. According to the SMTP protocol, mail servers can retry sending emails when the recipient's server has responded with one of these 4.x.x/soft bounces. Dyn will continue trying to send emails in this scenario until they have failed repeatedly for an extended period of time, at which point, the email address will become suppressed. Flagging as SPAM : When a recipient marks an email as spam, their email service will often report that back to the sender (Dyn, in this case), to let them know that the recipient has done so. In this case, the recipient is suppressed so as not to send them any more emails which they are considering SPAM. There are of course some exceptions to the rule – the notable one being GoDaddy . While almost all email services will respond with a 4.x.x code when they're throttling emails (meaning "" try again later !""), GoDaddy responds with a permanent failure message, which causes the recipient to become suppressed. You can read more about his in the Article titled GoDaddy Suppression.",False

One of which is the Seller Opt Out: Seller Directs Listing to Not Be Used in AVMs. Environment michael-ai Menu > Addor Change Listing > Listing Information > Broker Distribution Resolution Automated valuation model ( AVM ) is the name given to a service that can provide real estate property valuations using mathematical modeling combined with a database. Most AVMs calculate a property's value at a specific point in time by analyzing values of comparable properties. An AVM typically includes: An indicative market value for many residential properties nationwide. The tax assessor's indication of value, if available. Information on a subject property and recent sales history. Comparable sales analysis of like properties. The product of an automated valuation technology comes from analysis of public record data and computer decision logic combined to provide a calculated estimate of a probable selling price of a residential property. AVMs can vary greatly in quality and scope, depending on the type of data, completeness of data, and model design. AVMs usually include the tax assessor's value, all pertinent information on the property in question, such as its sales history, and an analysis of the sales of like-kind properties. Most AVMs use public records or Tax Assessment records to amass large databases of comparable property information in order to provide widespread coverage of a market area. Sales information is then added to the historical data on cycles (yearly, monthly, weekly) to update the models for the changes in market conditions over time. Assumptions and Gaps Unlike a professional appraiser, an AVM can't see the property. Instead, it assumes that the property is roughly similar to other homes in the neighborhood. This can lead to an overstated value for a property in bad condition or an understated value for a home in superior condition with many upgrades. Furthermore, AVMs are largely dependent on public record databases, and if those databases have incorrect or outdated information, the model will return an inaccurate valuation. AVMs may not distinguish between various sale types, such as foreclosures and traditional sales. For example, it could compare a well-kept traditional sale to a severely damaged foreclosed property sale.",False

16679250,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/UoH_/,SomeCompany- What is a VOW?,"Ever wondered what a VOW is and what is displayed? Virtual Office Website (VOW) : Acts as an online presence for brokerages. This type of brokerage operates virtually instead of (or in addition to) in a physical brick and mortar building. A VOW is different from a Syndicator in that Syndicators are not represented by a specific real estate office. A VOW has specific display rules: Because a Virtual Office Website (VOW) represents a licensed brokerage, VOWs are given access to all listing statuses (Active, UCB, CCBS, Temp Off Market, Pending, Closed, Expired, Cancelled). HOWEVER a VOW is required to have clients register (create a username/password) with their site before they are allowed to display Cancelled, Expired, or Temp Off Market status listings to that client. If a client visits a VOW and they do not have a username/password on that brokerage’s website, then they are only allowed to view Active, UCB, CCBS, Pending, and Closed status listings that have opted into IDX (public display). Examples of VOWs (Virtual Office Websites): Redfin virtual office website: https://www.redfin.com/ Redfin (flre001) is a licensed brokerage that is active with SomeCompany Rocket Homes Real Estate virtual office website: https://www.rockethomes.com/ Rocket Homes Real Estate (rckt001) is a licensed brokerage that is active with SomeCompany Syndicators gather listings for display depending on if the listing is opted into that specific syndication option or not. Examples of Syndicators: Realtor.com: https://www.realtor.com/ Home Snap https://www.homesnap.com/ A VOW website has two parts . When you first visit their website, you are looking at the IDX portion of the website. This is the public facing side . Listings in Active, UCB, CCBS, Pending, and Sold statuses will be available here. (If the listing agent has opted into the IDX export on their listing, if they do not have IDX checked the listing will not appear on the public IDX side of a VOW) If you visit Redfin, you’ll notice they have a “Join” option. Once a client joins and has the ability to log in to the website, they will be able to see the VOW portion of the website. The VOW side is able to display all statuses and all classes, including Expired, Temporarily Off Market, Cancelled, etc. (Regardless of whether or not the listing agent has elected to not export their listing, the VOW will always have access to all statuses and listings in the MLS, as a brokerage they are entitled to this data) Frequently Asked Questions Am I permitted to exclude some listings from display on my VOW? You may exclude listings from your VOW based only on objective criteria, such as location, price range, type of property, etc. Can an agent have his own VOW? Yes, an agent can have his own VOW but only if his Designated Broker gives permission and agrees to supervise the VOW. Why does my broker have to consent for me to operate my own VOW? Broker consent is required according to the NAR VOW Policy adopted as a result of its settlement with the Department of Justice. The broker must be accountable and supervise the operation of any VOWs of agents licensed under him. What if I discover a discrepancy in my listing between what is in MLS and what is displayed on a Participant’s or Subscriber’s VOW? You are entitled to demand that the VOW operator correct any errors by reporting the discrepancy to compliance@SomeCompany.com. Further, the VOW operator must provide a means to receive your comments. What is an AVP and do I have to use one? AVP stands for Affiliated VOW Partner. This is a third party that provides technology services, hosting and possibly marketing services to the Participant or Subscriber operating a VOW. If you or someone with your firm has the technical expertise to perform these services for you, you do not need to hire an outside AVP. If I operate a VOW do I need to get the consent of the listing brokers to display their listings? No. You do not need to seek the consent of listing brokers to have their listings appear on your VOW. What rights does a seller have regarding display of his property on my VOW? A seller may decline, at the point the listing is entered into MLS, to have his listing or the address displayed on the Internet. The seller may direct that automated valuation features and/or comments about their property be disabled as well on his listing. Can sellers “opt out” of showing their property listing on VOWs? Sellers may “opt out” of having their property listing displayed on any Internet sites, or “opt out” of having their property address displayed on any Internet sites. Sellers may not “opt out” of having their listings shown on some but not all VOW sites. This means that if a seller opts out of having his listing or property address displayed on VOWs, the listing (or property address) cannot be displayed on IDX sites, third party aggregator sites or elsewhere on the Internet. How do I handle showing VOW customers the property information of sellers who have opted out showing their property information on the Internet? A Participant or Subscriber may show such property information to a VOW customer by other means, such as email and fax. Am I prohibited from operating a VOW if I want to continue to provide an IDX search to consumers who use my website? A VOW operator may offer an IDX search as well as VOW functionality on the same website.

The site icon is associated with the URL and it is associated in one of two ways. The icon is saved to a root directory on their domain. The browser automatically locates the file and only displays the icon once the site is added to Favorites. The second method is a site icon is saved with HTML code and a link tag that specifies where the icon is saved. The URL will display in the address bar and when the site is added to Favorites the link tag tells the browser where to pull the icon from. Why does this affect someone who uses a favorite or desktop shortcut? If the favorite or desktop shortcut is created at any point after the michael-ai login screen there is additional information one does not see that is placed in the URL. That information changes as one navigates to different links and tabs within the site. Each time one visits the site using the favorite or desktop shortcut, the browser accesses the Temporary Internet Files and Session Cookies to try and load the site. At the same time the browser is accessing the server to pull new data it cannot populate from Temporary Internet Files and Session Cookies. Essentially it is trying to pull up the session that was saved as the shortcut link which causes problems. The browser can sometimes get confused during this process and think it does not need certain data from the server because it believes it has that information in Temporary Internet Files. The result is certain buttons, tabs and features within the site will begin to run and or display incorrectly. When you type the address the browser is going to that specific URL without adding an unseen path behind it. Typing the address all the way through (do not click from the drop down section) can help get the most current version of the site. We do not suggest saving michael-ai as a favorite even before logging into michael-ai. Having michael-ai as a favorite or shortcut can cause issues throughout the system. It may not happen all the time but it can cause issues. If one insists on using a desktop shortcut or favorite they can, but if they start having issues with the site it would be best to remove any old favorites or desktop shortcut then replace it with a new one. The new shortcut or favorite should be created from the michael-ai login prior to entering the user ID and password.",False

The Fannie Mae 1004MC is a specific statistical comparable market analysis (CMA) that appraisers must use when appraising a property that is applying for Fannie Mae financing. The report uses very specific criteria to display its results. Environment michael-ai, Statistical CMA Resolution How to run a 1004MC Report Run a Search to find comparable properties to your subject property. The search should include all statuses and should avoid any date ranges. You will set the reporting criteria when actually running the 1004MC. Click CMA . If you have results selected, the 1004MC will automatically be run on the selected properties only, regardless of whether you choose ""Use All Results"" or ""Use Selected."" Choose Statistical CMA. Uncheck ""Total Statistics"" – this option is not necessary for a 1004MC Check Fannie Mae 1004MC and choose the Effective Date for the report.

Using the example date ranges above, if a listing has a sold date of 02/01/2014; it will fall into the Prior 7-12 Months category. Absorption Rate (Total Sales/Months) The absorption rate is the number of Comparable Sales in the date range divided by the number of months in the date range. For example, if there are 24 listings in the ""Total # of Comparable Sales (Prior 7-12 Months)"" category, the Absorption Rate is calculated to be 4. This is computed by taking 24 divided by the 6 months in the date range. The ""Prior 4-6 Months"" and ""Current – 3 Months"" date ranges both span 3 months. So, if there are 18 comparable sales in the 'Prior 4-6 Months"" date range, the Absorption Rate is 6 (18 divided by 3). Total # of Active Listings As of the effective date in the appraisal, ""Total # of Comparable Active Listings"" is based on a specific point in time: the last (most recent) day in the time period. In the example above, 3 listings were active on 6/30/2014, 2 listings were active on 9/30/2014, and 1 listing was active on 12/31/2014, for this particular search. Months of Housing Supply For each date range, this number is calculated as: Total # of Active Listings divided by Absorption Rate. For example, if the Total # of Comparable Sales for the ""Prior 7-12 Months"" date range is 50 and the Absorption Rate for the same date range is 5, Months of Housing Supply is 10. Mean The sum of a list of numbers divided by the number of items in the list. Mean is often referred to as the average. Median The median is the ""middle number"" in a sorted list of numbers. Median Comparable Sale Price This is the median price for all sold listings in this date range. Median Comparable Sales DOM This is the median DOM for all sold listings in this date range. Median Comparable List Price This is the median price for all Active listings on the most recent date in each 3-month time period. Median Comparable Listings DOM This is the median DOM for all Active listings on the most recent date in each 3-month time period.

In the example below, that value is 132.12%. But percent of what? Estimated Percent Gain is the potential profit secured at auction if an individual were to win the auction for $1 more than the Opening Bid, as calculated by this formula: ((Estimated Value – Opening Bid)/Opening Bid)*100 For our example, if someone were to win the auction for $37,051 (that is, $1 more than the Opening Bid), that individual would stand to gain 132.12% of the amount paid ($37,051) were they to sell the property for the Estimated Value ($86,000).” Remember, the accuracy of values such as Estimated Percent Gain is determined by much more than the simple math outlined here.

16679436,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/DIL_/,RainStorm General Q & A,"Question: Why does a Foreclosure not have a minimum bid when the auction date is tomorrow? Answer: If the Foreclosure does not have a minimum bid by 9AM the day before the auction date then it will not actually be auctioned the next day. The auction will be cancelled. Question: Why do the Auction Date and Estimated Percentage Gain have red, green or no coloring? Answer: If they are not highlighted with a color then there is no Opening Bid. If they are highlighted with green then the Opening Bid is less than the Estimated Value. (This means the home is a good value) If they are highlighted with red then the Opening Bid is more than the Estimated Value. (This means the home is a bad value) Question: Where can I print labels? Answer: You can create labels for a list of search results if you are viewing the results as Cards or Rows Question: Multiple shapes on the map in RainStorm will act how? Answer: Multiple shapes on the map will act as “or”. (This means it will give the results from all the shapes) Question: Where can I save properties as Favorites? Answer: You can save properties as favorites under any tab, but you can only access the saved favorites under the MLS and Tax search tabs.  MLS Listings save as favorites under the MLS Favorite. All other Favorites save under the Tax Favorite. Question: Does the Parcel number and Universal Parcel ID fields have a limit? Answer: There is a 4000 character limit in these fields. 000-00-00, and then a space will equal about 275 parcel numbers total. Question: When I uncheck comps will my clients see those comps in the email? Answer: No, all comps that are unchecked will be left off the email. Question: When a loan is paid or released, will it be removed from RainStorm? Answer: No, RainStorm's Loan History is history of loan documents for that property with the current owner. Next Day Unverified : It means that TIM gets the information as its recorded from the affidavit (which is unverified) then anywhere from the next day to a week the deed will come to TIM and they will verify the information from the deed and the tag unverified will be removed and the information updated if need be with the set deed information.

The Statistical Average Field drop down list will include the Main fields for the different property types included in the search or in the Collection, however not all the fields are the same across each property type and this will affect the report results. Example: Column Headers do not match the data input in the columns. The report may still show calculations; however, the calculations will not include all the data in the column due to field names are not the same in both property types.

The My Map Overlays feature will let you draw shapes to be used repeatedly in multiple searches. Description Menu>Preferences>My Map Overlays Resolution To access the feature, navigate to Preferences -> My Map Overlays . That will lead to the Map Overlays editor, which is the place where one or more shapes can be created for an overlay. When you first go to My Map Overlays, you will have a list of all your saved overlays. You can create a new, edit, rename, remove or give someone a map overlay. Please note: Inline help is provided as you proceed through each step – so follow the bubbles if you are not sure what to do next. Inline help can be turned off by clicking on the Disable Inline Help link located at the bottom of each help bubble. Give to Someone (in your office) To give a map overlay to another user in your office, go to Preferences , My Map Overlays . From the My Map Overlays box, click on a name of an overlay in the list then click Give to Someone . In the Give Overlay to Someone box, type at least two characters of a name to pull up a list of members from within your office. Select a member from the list, and click Give . A copy of your map overlay will then be available on for the selected member on the My Map Overlay page. To get started , select NEW then zoom in to the area to draw a shape on and select the polygon tool ( NOTE : only polygon shapes can be drawn on a map overlay ). Multiple shapes can be within one Map Overlay. Once you have drawn a shape, you can click on the shape which will launch an edit bubble where you can name it , color it, or change its size after selecting Edit>>. In the bubble you can also select Street View, Bird’s Eye or Zoom Here. The right panel of the overlay editor contains two options: ‘Shapes’ and ‘Options & Permissions’. Simply click on either item to open options within each. ‘Shapes’ will have all the drawn polygons on the map. To remove one or more shapes, click on the X next to the shape name. You can also hover over the name to see which shape it is on the map. The Options & Permissions section includes a checkbox for Public Access (for IDX & Portals) . If the box is checked and you have purchased FBS’ IDX Solution for your personal website, then your clients will have access to the custom shape(s) as part of their search criteria. If you have not purchased FBS’ IDX Solution, then the custom shape(s) will display on the Map tab in an Interactive Email and in the client’s portal so they will know exactly which area was defined in the search criteria. Once you have completed drawing the desired shape(s), you will need to save the overlay by clicking on the Save button in the top right corner of the overlay editor. The overlay can be added to a Quick or Map search by using the My Map Overlays box (MLS#, Address, MMO box) found at the top of the criteria of either search. You can either search for the name of an overlay or shape by typing in the search box or clicking on the Browse link right next to it to bring up a list of overlays and shapes within them. Once you have added the shape, there are options to search Within , Intersection , or Not Within by clicking on the button next to the name of the overlay. Important Tips To maximize the benefits of this feature, you will want to understand some terminology and get in the practice of naming the shapes they draw . It can get confusing adding more than one overlay or shape to a search if they are not organized. Overlay : objects (shapes) on a map (i.e. the existing Map Grid and Zip Codes overlays in michael-ai) Shape : a polygon that can be drawn on a map to be included in an overlay When adding shapes from either of the saved overlays, it is difficult to know which one to pick as they are all labeled ‘Polygon’. It is very difficult to know which ‘Polygon’ to choose. Note: A single click on the name of the Overlay will change the list of Shapes to those included in the overlay. Once again, if they’re all named ‘Polygon’, it gets pretty confusing, pretty fast. Now it is easy to tell which shape(s) to add to the search. Save Overlay from Search Results Page Polygons that you have drawn on a map while conducting a search can be saved to a map overlay for reuse. Simply click the polygon on the map and then click on the Edit link. In the resulting bubble you will have the opportunity to name the shape, give it a color, and save the shape to a Map Overlay. Clicking on Save to Map Overlay will bring up a window that will allow you to create a new overlay or add polygon(s) to an existing overlay. When saving a New Overlay, the Public setting will be available. This option controls whether or not an overlay will appear in the Overlays dropdown on the map in your client’s Portal. If you are an owner of the FBS IDX Solution, it will also control whether or not the overlay is available to your clients to add as search criteria. In both cases, if Public is checked, it will be available. As you may recall, My Map Overlays provides the ability to draw and save polygons on a map. Therefore, any shapes drawn with the Rectangle or Circle tool will not be available to save to an overlay. Select the polygon(s) you would like to reuse later and click Save . You may also save polygon(s) by clicking the Save button then Save Polygons as My Map Overlay . The rest of the process is the same as above.",False

16679492,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/RIL_/,Preferred Internet Speeds and michael-ai,"Preferred Internet Speeds and michael-ai Understanding Internet Speeds Internet Speeds are not measured in terms of how fast they are, but rather how many packets of data are transferred per second, also known as allocated bandwidth. Bandwidth is measured in Megabits per second or Mbps . When you look at your standard internet plans, they will have two distinct speeds; a Download and an Upload. Download refers to transferring data from the Internet to your computer and Upload refers to transferring data from your computer to the Internet. Traditionally, the Download will be much higher in ISP Service Packages because most users tend to download more rather than upload. Here is a standard conversion to help you understand how Bandwidth is measured: 1 Byte (B) = 8 bits (b) 1 Megabit (Mb) = 1,048,576 bits 1 MegaByte (MB) = 8 Megabits or 8,388,608 bits So, let's say for example, your internet speed Download is currently at 6Mbps and you go and download a 6MB photo. Your internet speeds are sending information at approx. 6 million bits per second meaning that the download will take 8 Seconds. Here is the math: 6MB = 50,331,648 bits ( 1 MegaByte X 6 ) divided by 6,291,456 bits ( 1 Megabit X 6Mbps ) = 8 seconds With higher bandwidths, the network downloads more packets at a time, making your web surfing experience much faster. Optimal Speeds for michael-ai While there is no ""exact speed"" set in stone to make michael-ai work, lower speeds will present problems with web pages loading or Browsers timing out. The chart below gives examples of optimal speeds to run the michael-ai Website: 1.5 - 4 Mbps – these are considered Dial Up Speeds . Anything below 1Mbps will not load most websites including michael-ai . 1.5 to 4Mbps will load websites like michael-ai very slowly. You may come into problems with loading results or websites timing out at these Speeds. Videos will lag and stutter do to buffering problems. 4-6 Mbps – These speeds are considered a slow but workable level. michael-ai will run (not optimally) with minimal problems, especially when loading large searches. Video Streaming (like Netflix) also becomes available. 6-10 Mbps – This range is the preferred minimum speed for michael-ai. The webpage will load results with normal speed. This is also considered the minimum required for online gaming or Video on Demand. 10-15 Mbps – At this speed, Web based applications and cloud services will be much quicker, and High Definition video will play without issue. michael-ai should perform without issue. 15-50 Mbps – This is the optimal speed when you have many devices connected to your network (multiple laptops, gaming systems, etc). michael-ai will perform excellently on a network with these speeds. 50 + Mbps – Considered High Speed Internet. Performing Speed Tests to Troubleshoot If you are experiencing issues with the webpage loading slowly or not at all, it is possible that it could stem from a network issue. The first step into diagnosing the problem is to perform a Speed Test. A Speed Test will send an Information Packet from your computer to the closest test server to determine the speed of delivery, giving you three distinct Speed results: The Upload , the Download , and the Ping . The Ping in a SpeedTest is how fast the server responded to the connection the test was trying to send. Ping is measured in Milliseconds, so a lower ping means a faster connection. The Download Speed will be what we want to focus on in the case of michael-ai, unless you are specifically having issues with Uploading photos to a listing. Perform the steps below to determine your network connection: Step 1: Go to www.speedtest.net Step 2: Click on the GO circle (sometimes will say Begin Test ) Step 3: After the Test has performed, analyze the Download Speed. What effects Network Connectivity? If the SpeedTest returns less than stellar results, there may be some factors effecting the connectivity speeds. Below you will find a list of possible issues with why internet speeds could be slowed: Components within the PC/Computer – Older computers might have lower Processor speeds, available Memory, etc. Number of Applications Open – If you have multiple applications open and has a speed lower than 10Mbps, you will encounter a slowdown because of the low amount of available Bandwidth. Hardware: Router, Modem, Wires – Optimal internet speeds heavily rely on the Hardware. Old Modem's, Routers, and Ethernet cables can cause intermittent issues. Hardware should be replaced between 4-5 years of use or sooner if you notice reoccurring problems with the connections. Wi-Fi Signal – When it comes to connections, a solid wired connection (Ethernet Cable) will always be faster than Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is affected by obstacles such as: Interference from Objects and Walls in your Home (blocked signals) Distance of Router to the Computer (weak signals) Multiple Devices connected to Wi-Fi (such as Phones, Game Consoles, etc.) Virus (Adware, Spyware, Malware) – Do you notice multiple Pop-ups when attempting to access websites? Perhaps the entire PC is slowed down from startup. A virus can drain the computer's resources without the user noticing and therefore cause connectivity issues. We would refer you to AAR for Virus removal, however, there are a few trusted anti-viral protectors we can recommend like Malwarebytes. Internet Rush Hour – Like actual Rush Hour, Internet Rush hours cause speed slowdowns during peak hours due to high internet activity and congestion. These hours are estimated from about 7pm – 11pm. This is also determined on a community level. Do you share DSL or Cable providers with all your neighbors? Chances are there will be slowdown if you are all logging in and downloading/streaming at the same time. Troubleshooting Network Issues? While we don't expect you to be a Network Expert, there are a few steps you can take to try and troubleshoot the Network Connections: Restart the Router/Modem – Sounds like a cop out but sometimes a Router just needs a good old-fashioned reboot. Routers get Firmware Updates pushed through them that sometimes need a kickstart. If you need to unplug the router, first disconnect from the Internet, then unplug the Router for 30 seconds before plugging back in. Bring the Laptop closer to the Router – As stated before, sometimes walls or objects obstruct the frequency waves of the Wi-Fi. Bringing the computer closer to the Router will increase the signal strength. Directly plug into a Router – If it is just not feasible to bring the computer any closer to the router, we suggest using a direct connection with an Ethernet Cable. Ethernet Cables eliminate signal obstructions and increase speeds, almost double in some cases. Call and speak to your ISP (Internet Service Provider) – If the SpeedTest is reporting numbers that are far below what you are paying for, you will want to contact your ISP. Sometimes a Hard boot (also called a Handshake) from the ISP's is needed to jumpstart your speeds. You can report the speeds you are getting in a SpeedTest to your Network Provider (Cox, CenturyLink, etc.) and see if they have any ideas on their end. Replace Hardware – If none of the above steps have worked, it may be time to replace the Hardware, especially on older models. If directly connecting via an Ethernet doesn't work, you should start by replacing the Cable. If the Router/Modem is older than 5 years, you will want to consider replacing those as well. If all Hardware is relatively new, then you may want to look at updating their Computer. NOTE: We are not stating this NEEDS to be done. Your ISP should be contacted for verification.",False

16679535,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/b4L_/,Short Sale vs. Bank Owned Properties (REO),"A Short Sale is a sale of secured real property that produces less money than is owed the lender; also called a short pay, in that the lender releases its mortgage or trust deed so that the property can be sold free and clear to the new purchaser. In essence, the lender decides to cut its losses by agreeing to a negotiated sale rather than experiencing the delay and expense of a foreclosure action, with the possible result of owning the asset and thus carrying a 'real estate owned' on its books. Real estate brokers should understand that the lender often requires that the brokers adjust their commissions before the sale takes place - even though the lender is not on the title, it is often positioned to call the shots. The proliferation of short sales in the Valley is a byproduct of the decline of property values as a result of the collapse of the overall real estate market. Previously short sales were rare. Today the number of short sale eligible property is growing, and brings with it issues and challenges to handling these properties in MLS. The document for Short Sale Q&A can be found on www.SomeCompany.com under Rules, then Short Sale Policy . Real Estate Owned (REO) , also known as lender owned or bank owned, is a term used by lenders to describe real property involuntarily acquired by them through foreclosure. Lenders often use brokers to market their REO properties.* REO is a term used in the US to describe a class of property owned by a lender after an unsuccessful sale at a foreclosure auction . A foreclosing beneficiary will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high loan-to-value mortgage following a real estate bubble . As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset ( non-performing asset ). *AZ DI Note - REO owned properties should have the ""Lender Owned/REO"" feature selected in the SLC field of the listing.",False
16679538,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/coL_/,Statistical Market Report (One-click CMA),"One main question we get is, “why isn't the Sold Price/ SQFT calculated correctly?”. Agents often take the HIGH Sold Price and the HIGH Approx. SQFT and divide it, thinking that this would be the Sold Price/SQFT. As you can see in the table below, each listing already has a calculated List Price/SQFT and Sold Price/SQFT, so the Statistical Market Report is not calculating the Price/SQFT, it is taking the lowest and the highest numbers from the listings. Here are the numbers that I used in the Report: MLS# List Price Sold Price Approx. SQFT List Price/SQFT Sold Price/SQFT 4685046 101,000 101,000 2328 43.38 43.38 4697788 109,900 107,000 2136 51.45 50.09 4852743 110,000 110,000 2178 50.51 50.51 4296656 115,900 112,500 2302 50.35 48.87 4287714 115,000 115,000 2302 49.96 49.96 High and Low With the Statistical Market Report the first line is LOW , so the lowest number for each of those categories are: List Price Sold Price Approx. SQFT List Price/SQFT Sold Price/SQFT LOW 101,000 101,000 2136 43.38 43.38 The HIGH numbers take the highest number for each category, for this report they are: List Price Sold Price Approx. SQFT List Price/SQFT Sold Price/SQFT HIGH 115,900 115,000 2328 51.45 50.51 With this report most of the LOW numbers are with the same listing but as you can see with the HIGH, they are all different listings for each category, so it does depend on the results you have but each line for LOW, and HIGH are not one listing. In other words, the rows do not correspond to the same listing from left to right, each column pulls data from different listings depending on which ones have the highest and lowest numbers. For Average it takes all the numbers, adds them together and then is divided by the number of listings. For Example, the Sold Price: Add all the Sold Prices together and divide them by the total number of listings. 101,000+107,000+110,000+112,500+115,000=545,500 545,500/5= 109,100 The Average Sold Price is 109,100 List Price Sold Price Approx. SQFT List Price/SQFT Sold Price/SQFT Average 110,360 109,100 2249.2 49.13 48.56 If an Agent or Appraiser uses the Median Calculation the median is the middle number. If there is an even number of listings it will take the 2 middle numbers and split the difference between those two numbers. For example if the 2 middle List Prices are 100,000 and 110,000 the difference between them is 10,000 if you divide that by two you have 5,000 so the Median in this case is 105,000.",False

On maps, these geopolitical anomalies will form jagged or complex borders and 'holes' in the city limits. Because these patches of land are not incorporated into the city surrounding them, they usually fall under the jurisdiction of the county in which they are located. Hence the term County Island.

Environment michael-ai, browser, Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari. Resolution Accessing the settings of the browser being used to clear cookies and cache. Cause (optional) Many times, web developers must make updates to the files that comprise the site in order to push a change or new feature live (michael-ai updates all the time). If they change a file that your browser has cached, it’s going to keep serving the old, cached version of the file and you won’t see the most recent changes. The cache folder has a definite size and limit. If the number of items it stores gets too large, then your current browsing session could suffer as page elements could appear as broken. We see this a lot with jumbled text problems, old pictures loading, and menu items missing.  This would explain some of the issues we hear about regarding broken text, jumbled pages, and old pictures popping up. More importantly, you should clear your browser cache to load the latest version of a webpage or a program. An overloaded browser cache could also slow down browsing because by default it looks to the cache folder for downloaded files. Agents experiencing Search results not loading or loading very slow might be experiencing this type of issue. Any website you visit is actually a composition of hundreds or even thousands of files. Even websites which are highly optimized for speed are likely to load a lot of files at any point to display the content in your browser. Browsers try to do their part to speed up the loading process. The first time you visit a site, the browser will save pieces of the site (logos, navigation buttons, animations, etc.), because the browser can display the files stored in its cache much faster than it can pull fresh files from a server. The next time you visit that site, the cached files (also called Temporary Internet Files) will help cut down the page load time.",False

RETS stands for Real Estate Transaction Standard and is a type of database and query language that allows users to pull out the fields and data for listings directly from michael-ai. The most common use of a RETS feed is for a broker to find a vendor to build an IDX search to their exact specifications.

Below you will see the field and where to gather that info. Listing dates: Listing dates are the dates the listing will appear in the MLS, and not necessarily the execution date or the date it was signed. You can find these dates in your listing contract. Ownership: This is the ownership type for the property. This information can be found on the deed of the house, which can be provided by your owner. Auction: This field is only “Yes” if the owner is choosing to put the property up for auction, not a foreclosure. SubAgents: A subagent is a cooperating agent who works for a listing broker-salesperson in the sale of a property. See https://SomeCompany.com/subagents-in-the-mls Variable Commission: The REALTOR® Code of Ethics defines a variable-rate commission arrangement as a listing in which one amount of commission is payable if the listing broker’s firm is the procuring cause of sale and a different amount of commission is payable if the sale results from the efforts of the seller or a cooperating broker. Consult your broker for more information. Schools: Finding the school associated with your property can be tricky. The school districts can be found in RainStorm. If you click on the district it will take you to their website where you can use the boundary maps to find the correct schools for your property. Recommended School Search Method Public vs Private remarks: Public remarks should only be used to market the property and should not contain any information that is not privy to the public i.e. websites, agent names, phone numbers, gate and/or lockbox codes or commission information. Private remarks: Private remarks are agent-to-agent remarks that are not to be shared with a client. See https://SomeCompany.com/meaning-dnd2 Semi Private Remarks: These are agent-to-agent remarks that can be shared with a client. Payment and Rate info : These fields are required, and it is best practice to enter “zero” in these fields. Questions regarding finances are best answered by the lender. HOA: The Home Owners Association (HOA) field information will come from the home owner and/or their HOA. Bedrooms+: The bedrooms plus field is a unique field that allows you to let a buyer know there are additional rooms in the house not typically used as a bedroom that could be used as an additional bedroom.

19267598,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/DgAmAQ,SomeCompany- Internal Admin FAQ,"old info Cost of an Admin account is $68 every 3 months (as of January 1, 2024). How will staff resolve an issue if the broker selected the wrong office ID? The Broker will have to de-activate the account and resubmit the application under the correct office ID. How will staff undo accidentally ‘rejecting’ an admin application. There is no way to ""undo"" rejected admin requests, the broker would need to submit a new admin request. Please check with an L2 before having broker re-submit a new request. How will staff deactivate an admin account that either needs urgent/immediate shut off or has been identified of no longer qualifying for admin credentials? The Designated Broker of the office can turn off the admin account access within their Atlas account. The Designated Broker can also request the change in writing where staff can disable the admin account. A Broker says a specific office is not in the Admin application drop down in Atlas. What should I do? Search for the company name in michael-ai office/member search and find the office they are missing. Check if the right Participant/Broker is marked as the “Designated Broker” for that office. If not, reach out to the association of the office and ask them to fix the office record. A user with personal agent level admin permissions cannot access the sponsoring agent’s michael-ai account. What should staff check for? Does the user have and know how to utilize the impersonation feature? If not, walk them through how to use it. Is the impersonation feature connected to the correct sponsoring agent? Review the Superuser tab of the admins account settings to check. How does staff or the Participant/Broker identify the level of admin permission granted to the admin user? Staff can identify the level within Atlas by searching for the Designated Broker, selecting Staff Permissions, then typing in the subscriber's MLS ID. Admin accounts were created with an m, c, or o near the end. (m= agent level, c=company level, and o=office level) during December 2018 through the beginning of April 2019. This would have told staff and the participant/broker the access the admin account was created with. However, this caused confusion when admins needed to have both agent level access and office/company access. For this reason, the naming convention on all admin IDs in michael-ai will contain an “os” (os = office staff) rather than a single letter trying to identify their broker load. The accounts created December 2018 - early April 2019 will not be changed to match this new naming convention. Can Admins be approved if the michael-ai System is down? No, Admins should not be approved if the michael-ai System is down. Depending on what is down (Spark, API, Front-End, etc.), admin approvals and creation could be affected. It is safer to halt all approvals until after the issue has been fixed. When a broker de-activates an admin in ATLAS, does an email go out to the broker confirming that an admin has been turned off? No email is sent for de-activations but refreshing the Office Staff screen in ATLAS will display the de-activated admin with the Active field toggled off as a confirmation. When does a broker/participant file a waiver for an agent? If an agent has an active license and does not need access to the MLS, a waiver is needed and the broker/participant can find the application at https://SomeCompany.com/docs/application-forwaiver-of-mls-subscriber-fee.pdf . The waiver needs to be submitted to support@SomeCompany.com. How long will the turn-around time take when submitting for new applications? A same-day approval for admins is likely if the application is submitted early in the day and without errors. Approvals can take longer on high-volume days or under unusual circumstances. Will we transfer funds or accounts from one admin to another? Admin accounts are non-refundable and non-transferable. We understand that staff may leave you from time to time and that is why admin subscriptions are for 90-days, not 365, so the unused portion of an account is minimized. We will only refund/move payments made in error if reported within a day or two. Can my office/managing broker submit an admin application for me? The admin management portion of Atlas is only available to Designated Brokers currently. This feature has been requested by other participants and may be added in the future. Can I submit an admin application or deactivate an admin account on my mobile device? The admin application does not work on mobile devices currently but will be a feature coming soon. How much is the fee for an admin / how do the subscription dates work? The cost is $68 per admin for a 90-day subscription, paid by the admin or the broker. For example, $68 would be due now and then again 91 days from today. I’m having trouble paying, can staff process an admin payment for me? Yes, the Helpdesk is able to process a payment for an admin's account. If you are a broker, ensure that you are in the correct system to pay by going to https://Atlas.SomeCompany.com , where you would login with your michael-ai username/password. Click Office, Manage Staff on the home-screen and then click the Purchase button next to the admin you wish to pay for. You can select more than one admin account to include in the payment. Can an admin with agent level permission have super-user access to multiple Subscribers? Yes. The online admin application requires at least one sponsoring agent, to add more, the broker is able to add multiple IDs to the permission form. When did old admin accounts stop working? All old admin IDs containing an 'a' or 's' were deactivated at 1:00 a.m. Arizona time on 1/8/2019. How do I correct admin profile information? The Designated Broker must send an email to Support@SomeCompany.com requesting the changes be made to the account, Profile information such as an email address, phone number, misspellings can be updated. I'm an office admin, my brokerage was bought out. Can I have super user access to both offices. No. You can only have access to 1 office at a time.

20545843,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/M4E5AQ,RETS Q & A,"The RETS PASSWORD has been sunset, the primary user of this legacy function was Zipforms. Zipforms is now operated by LoneWolf/TransactionDesk. This vendor no longer requires agents to input their RETS Settings password in order to pull listing data into forms. Web API will be the only option available for new data feeds as of 11/16/2022 Currently existing RETS feed that wants to upgrade to API can reach out to contract@SomeCompany.com If a currently existing RETS feed user has questions about their current feed they can email api@SomeCompany.com Agents can sign up now to start the process of changing from RETS to API SomeCompany.com/rets-to-api What is RETS? RETS is a framework used in Canada & the United States by the Real Estate industry to facilitate the exchange of data. Basically, a Data Feed. What does RETS stand for? Real Estate Transaction Standard. RETS Password vs RETS Feed? How to tell the difference? It is assumed you are asking SomeCompany about the RETS password under the profile to do a data sync with Top Producer or Zipforms MLS Connect. If you want a RETS password for a Data feed for anything other than Zipforms, MLS Connect, or Top Producer, you are not asking about the RETS Password under the Profile. What Products do Agents use their RETS Password on? Only Top Producer, and Zipforms MLS Connect have ever used the RETS Password Where do I use the RETS password in Zipforms? You would only use it once the MLS Connect button in Zipforms is clicked. How do you use MLS Connect? Once the MLS Connect button is clicked this should be the screen you see: The MLS User ID is just that. The Agents ID . The Password is the RETS Password . Then you will type in the MLS Listing ID . Choose the Listing type (Residential is the Default) and then click Find. Once the property info is filled in, verify the correct listing shows up. Then click Import and answer the prompted questions. You do not use the RETS password to log into Zipforms. You need to call AAR if you can’t get logged into Zipforms. RETS passwords that are not for Zipform’s MLS Connect or Top Producer are Passwords for IDX Feeds or API Feeds and you need to contact RETS@SomeCompany.com (VOW feeds can be either IDX or API). Who do I contact regarding RETS? For Technical Questions, please email rets@SomeCompany.com Examples: Questions from Vendors: I need to whitelist an IP Address How do I pull the Hi-Res photos? My Username/Password is not working (to access Feed) Note: Only people who signed the agreement can ask for the Username and Password. For Contractual Questions, please email contracts@SomeCompany.com Examples: Broker, Affiliated Agent wants to know what is needed to setup feed How much does a feed cost? I want to become a third-party vendor, etc If you (or the agent) have questions regarding the Contracts@SomeCompany.com email, you can reach out to Kristine B who monitors that inbox. Her ext. is 7180 If a Vendor is calling to speak with someone, you will want to reach out to James directly at ext. 7187. James prefers if you leave a Voicemail.
