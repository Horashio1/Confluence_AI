11862402,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/ggG1,My Market Information?,"My Market The My Market reports show a variety of information about the current and recent state of your MLS market.  Five charts track and display statistics regarding your MLS market: Inventory, Sold DOM vs. Sold Price, Sold DOM vs. Units, Volume & Average Price, and Hot Sheet Price Change Trends.  Select the report you would like to view from the drop-down list. Note: These reports do not display up-to-the-minute statistics. Instead, they use previously cached data in order to generate information as quickly as possible.  As a result, recently updated listings may not be reflected in the report. You may generate the graphs from any search criteria, allowing for nearly unlimited customization of the data represented. Click the Customize button to define your criteria.  You may use a full search or a saved search to focus your results.  Please be aware, however, that choosing a listing status will significantly affect the resulting chart.  For example, a saved search for ""Active"" listings will not return relevant information about sold listings.  You may also use a previous Full Search from this session - such that if you have refined your search multiple times without navigating away from the My Market page, you can go back to a previous full search to view its statistics again. Inventory - The My Market Inventory chart gives a graphical representation of the state of your MLS market over the past two years. Using the bars and the red, gold, and black lines, you may track the inventory at rate of sales, and the number of active, new, and sold listings. The bars represent the months of inventory at the current rate of sales. The vertical legend at the left side of the graph shows the units of measurement, or you may hover over any bar to see the exact measurement for that month. The red, gold, and black lines correspond to the vertical legend at the right side of the graph. The red line tracks by month the number of active listings, black the number of sold listings, and gold the number of new listings. Hover your cursor over each line on any month to see exact values for that month. Below the graph, you may look at a numeric representation of the data. In table format, you may easily compare listings and inventory month-by-month over the selected time period. Sold DOM vs. Sold Price - The Sold DOM vs. Sold Price report displays a comparison between the Average Days on Market (the number of days between begin date and pended date) for Sold listings and Average Sold Price. The Average Days on Market are represented by columns, and the Average Sold Price by a black line. Data is presented for the past two years. Sold DOM vs. Units - The Sold DOM vs. Units graph charts Average Days on Market (the number of days between begin date and pended date) and Sold Units. The columns represent the DOM, and the black line represents the number of Sold Units. Below the graph, you may look at a numeric representation of the data. Volume & Average Price - The Volumes & Average Prices graph compares the Sold Volume (bars) to the Average List Price of the sold listings (grey line), and the Average Sold Price (black line) over the last selected time period. Hot Sheet Price Change Trends - The Hot Sheet Price Change Trends graph charts the Average Price Change percentage in comparison to the Average Price Change in dollars. This graph is based on only those listings where the list price was changed.

11862404,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/hAG1,TrueCloud Chat Basics- Expectations,"Response Times in Chat If you do not know the answer right away, make sure you are letting the subscriber know you are researching their inquiry.  This will let them know they are not being ignored. If you respond with a question or answer, and the subscriber does not answer back, these guidelines should be followed: If no response after 2 minutes , Support should respond with “ Are you still there? ” or “ Is there anything else I can assist you with? After this, wait another 2 minutes .  If no response, you will post the Bye chat canned response and end the chat.  We should not be waiting more than 4 minutes for a response. When is it appropriate to Call during a Chat Resetting Passwords in Chat We should NEVER ask a subscriber to verify Key Pin or Security Questions through Chat.  If a subscriber is having password trouble or PIN trouble, we should be going above and beyond by offering to call the them ourselves. Clearing Cookies/Cache with an Agent in Chat In order for the c lea r to complete, the subscriber must close out of all internet windows, including the Chat.  Instead of pasting the directions of how to Clear (and not knowing if it worked or not), we should be calling the subscriber and verbally walking them through the process.  This will help clear any confusion as well as make sure their issue has been solved. Calling Etiquette in Chat If a subscriber is having difficulty and asks for you to call them, or if they can call you, please follow through with the call yourself . DO NOT pawn the call of on another Support Person.  Making the agent call into Support will worsen the situation by forcing another Support Person to enter the call blindly.  The subscriber will be required to repeat themselves and a lot of time will be wasted for both. If our goal is to provide the industry benchmark for customer service, then we should be trying our best to make the situation better for all, not worse. Transferring a Chat Occasionally you may connect with an subscriber who has dropped the previous chat accidentally.  They may ask to be transferred back to their original Support Person so they do not have to explain themselves again.  You can find out who this is (if the agent did not name them) by checking the Atlas or reaching out in L1 Teams.  Under no circumstances should we ever “Cold Transfer” the Chat to this person.  If an Agent wishes to be transferred you will reach out to the party and make sure they are able to take the Chat.  If they are not, you can ask for the condensed version of their problem, then attempt to solve it yourself. Business Communication E tiquette Regardless of the medium that is being used to communicate with subscribers (in-person, phone, chat, email) maintain our level of professionalism . This includes, but is not limited to, proper grammar, capitalization, sentence structure, avoiding slang and abbreviations as much as possible.",False

The Listing Agent will need to individually contact each agent they would like to reach. In Metro MLS , a listing agent can select up to 200 agents at a time to send a Reverse Prospecting message to (System will not function correctly if you have over 200 selected. would need to send in batches of, at most, 200 at a time ).

11862424,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/mAG1,Property Panorama,"Property Panorama is no longer a product provided by SomeCompany with your subscription package, but it is still available at a small cost. What does Property Panorama do? Property Panorama will automatically create virtual tours, using photos in MLS, for SomeCompany listings for use by the Listing Agent. Tours will be created for eligible listings meeting all the following requirements: Have at least three photos In an Active or UCB status Included for display on internet Seller Directs Listing to be Excluded from Internet export setting is not checked Included for IDX IDX export setting is checked In a property type available via IDX Business Opportunity listings are not available in IDX *If any of these items are ‘No’ then a video will not be generated. * How are tours generated? When a new eligible listing is added (or an existing listing becomes eligible), a tour will be generated, and an email is sent to the Listing Agent containing a link to the tour. What to do if I don't receive the email with the tour link? Go to the Menu. Search 'Property Panorama'. Click Property Panorama. Property Panorama will open in the agents account using a Single Sign On. Click the Linking Page button for the property you want to copy the link for. Copy the link under the InstaView Lite. How to Copy: Highlight the link and right click the mouse button. Then click Copy from the dropdown menu or highlight the link and hold down Ctrl and click C.  Click the michael-ai Web Tab to go back to michael-ai and add the link to the Virtual Tour for the listing. Property Panorama checks for new/modified listings every 6 hours (or four times/day). How are tours added to listings in michael-ai? Once a Listing Agent receives a tour link via email or copies it from Property Panorama, the Subscriber will need to manually add the tour to their listing in michael-ai by: Going to the Add/Change screen for the listing Select Virtual Tour Add the link by pasting the link into the field. If the Subscriber does not want to use the tour, they simply take no action. What is contained in the InstaView Lite “free” tour? The InstaView Lite free tours will contain at least three and up to five photos from the listing. (These will be the first three to five photos on the listing in the MLS.) There is not an option to select specific photos from the listing, so the desired photos must be placed in the desired ordered in the first 3 to 5 photo positions. What happens if more photos are added/moved/removed from the listing after the tour has been created? The existing link will be updated with the new photos displaying the first three to five photos in the MLS system, so there is nothing the Listing Agent will need to do to see the changes reflected in a tour they have already posted. This will not happen immediately as Property Panorama only checks for new/modified listings every 6 hours (or four times/day). What happens when a listing goes to Pending (or other off market status) and then returns to Active or UCB? The free tours created will become inactive when the listing is changed to an off market status (or fails to meet any of the eligibility requirements). During this time, the user has total access to the tours but they will NOT be viewable to the public. If the listing is returned to Active or UCB status, the existing tour will be reactivated, thus no action is required by the Listing Agent. This will not happen immediately as Property Panorama only checks for new/modified listings every 6 hours (or four times/day) . What if a Subscriber already has a tour(s) in MLS? Will the Property Panorama tour replace the existing tour(s) in the system? The capacity for virtual tour links in the MLS system is unlimited. Thus the Property Panorama tour would just be added to the existing tours in MLS. The virtual tour is not automatically added to the listing so it will not replace tours that are already in the system. How often does Property Panorama update the Tour links? Tour links are updated every six hours (or four times/day). Who does a Subscriber contact if they are having trouble with a tour from Property Panorama? If they need assistance adding a tour to their listing in michael-ai, we (the SomeCompany HelpDesk) can assist them. They can call our HelpDesk at 480-303-7020, or email information@SomeCompany.com .

13566351,page,current,https://michael-ai.com/x/jwHP,New Portal 2.0 Q and A,"Portal 2.0 - Frequently Asked Questions What will the New Portal 2.0 look like: (In short: Much like the michael-ai App) Menu on the left Double row of Listings displayed as Cards in the middle or one row if the monitor is small. Map on the right Search bar at the top Where did the Dashboard go? Everything that is contained in the dashboard is now in the Menu to the left or in the messages option in the top right. It's now going to be all on one screen for easy access. Why did the new Portal come about? We are making the switch to simplify and update the Portal. The mobile version and the desktop version will be virtually the same in look and feel. The new Portal 2.0 has been released for 2 years in other markets. We elected to not release it until it had been beta tested by other markets. What are the new Features? Client Searches: The clients will be able to do their own searches but will not be able to save them unless agents have the IDX Manager from FBS. All on one-page display: The clients will not have to click around to find anything. Everything is displayed on one page. The Searches and collections to the left. The results in the middle and the map for location to the right. Simplify is the name of the game. The Updated Messages: The messages from Client to Agent and vice versa will look much like text messages: Agent can see Most Recent Unsaved Search parameters: In the clients Portal tab agents can check to see what their clients are searching for. This will indicate if the agent should contact the client and modify the saved search based off what the client is looking for. Client tutorials: The client will get pop up tutorials one at a time that are short and sweet to explain where everything is and what it does. If the Client Dismissed the tutorials they will not be available for review later. Please refer the client to the Client tutorial video on SomeCompany.com. Client can start and stop Subscriptions: The client can click on any saved search. Click the notifications bell on and get subscriptions or turn it off to stop the subscription emails. Important Note: No, there is not a way to know if the agent or client turned the subscription on or off. If the bell is not available, they are most likely on the News Feed or a collection not a search. If the client side says, ""Notifications are DISABLED"" this means that the search does not meet the minimum required fields for a subscription email to be set up. Basically, the search must use at least 3 fields for a subscription to be activated on the client side. How long will the intro video stay on the Portal Preferences screen? There is currently no plan to remove it. Why is supplement not an option to turn off now? The new portal is simplifying everything, even the settings. Supplement is just an extension of the public remarks. There was never an option to turn that off, so it makes sense to remove that setting as well. Click the More on the public remarks to read the supplement. Why are photos, videos, and virtual tours not an option to turn off now? Simplifying the settings is key. It's expected to see these things. If the photos and videos were not available, then most subscribers reported this as a bug and not an intended setting. Turning Photos, Videos, and Virtual Tours off in the settings was usually an accident. Vacation Available Dates calendar is not in the portal for Vacation rentals? This was custom programing for our MLS. We put in a ticket to have it added to the portals but currently have no ETA. On Vacation rentals the Current Price (High season) will show just like on other websites such as Zillow. Lo season price is in the detail information below the picture in the General Information section. Does the subscription notify the agent in anyway when the client turns it off? No Is there a way to tell if the agent or client created the search in the portal? The client's saved search will be listed on the Portal tab. The agent's saved search will be listed on the Searches/Subscriptions tab. Please Note: The agent must have an IDX Manager subscription from FBS in order for the client to have the ability to save their searches. You can identify the agents who have this subscription because they will have an option for ""IDX Manager"" under their Preferences in the Menu. Is there a way to see if the client or the agent created the subscription? No On the new Portal is there a way for the agent to Feature their listings? Yes, If the option in Portal Preferences: My Listings is turned ON then when the client visits the portal home page, they will see the agents Active Listings. This setting use to be an IDX Manager Feature only. Is there a way for the agent to see the client's portal? No, the View Portal button has been removed. We were told it was because it caused too much confusion. Agents would be on the desktop and the clients would be on a mobile device and neither understood why they weren't seeing the same things. Also, the View Portal didn't show things like the messages the client and agent wrote to each other. I would suggest that the agent set up their own portal, so they know what it looks like for the client. How long will the ability to switch from the old portal to the new portal last? There is not yet a defined time for the Classic Portals to be completely sunset and removed. How can the agent recommend listings, Save listings and Hide them on behalf of the client if they don't have a View Portal button? This can all be done the way it's intended by working on behalf of the client. Click the Searches/Subscriptions tab in the clients contact. Click the search. Click View all under the Results section and when going from the clients contact to the search results will automatically be working on behalf of the client. The Star (Save), Suitcase(Recommend), No Smoking Sign(Hide), and Note pad (Listing Note) will be available for the agent to use. When this is released will the system automatically change the agent's portal to the Portal 2.0 or will the agent have to manually change it? The agent will have to manually change it in the Portal Preferences and clicking the blue button, ""Try the new michael-ai Portal"" or if they do not wish to switch and need to see the Classic portal settings the agent will need to click the link, ""Access Classic Portal Settings"". When the New portal is applied to the account the Manual E-mail screen will be changed. The options above reflect the option available in the New portal. When the link is opened in the manually sent email it will be opening on the same mobile view/desktop view as the New portal would have. Below is an example of what the email link will open to on a desk top. Click the Card photo to see more details of each listing. However, manual emails will no longer be stored in the Portal 2.0. If using the Portal 2.0, permalinks are no longer customizable. Also, currently there is not a way to ""Save"" the preferred options if an agent calls and wants to know why when they uncheck Tax Info and they come back to this screen its checked again. If you get a complaint or suggestion, please send it to the MLSdept email. There is a ticket open for this. The more agents IDs we get the faster they will be to fix the issue. The notepad for Listing Notes is no longer available for the client to view or read. Agents should use the messaging feature for the conversations about the listing. Agents when ""Working on Behalf of Client Name "" in the search should use the person icon: and then click: Clients will use the big blue button in the upper right called: Contact Agent or View Conversation or There is no longer an option to be notified when the client logs into the portal when the New Portal is applied to the account in the Contact Management screens Portal tab: This option in the classic portal only worked when the client logged into the portal via a Desktop computer. Any mobile device that accessed the portal would not send a notice back to FBS's servers to show a login happened. Because the majority of portal logins are done from a mobile device it made the feature almost obsolete.",False
